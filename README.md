# RAMP starting kit on Accidents Severity classification


_Authors: Chaima El Hif, Mohamed Ben Jebara, Nour Elkamel, Taher Asmi, Chaima Messai & Salma Ezzina_

For each injury accident (i.e. an accident on a public roadway involving at least one vehicle and 
at least one victim requiring medical attention), information describing the accident 
is entered by the law enforcement unit (police, gendarmerie, etc.) that responded to the accident.

The goal of this RAMP is to detect the severity of each accident using these information. 

It's a multiclassification task.


#### Set up

Open a terminal and

1. install the `ramp-workflow` library (if not already done)
  ```
  $ pip install ramp-workflow
  ```
  
2. Follow the ramp-kits instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/Getting-started-with-a-ramp-kit)

#### Local notebook

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](solar_wind_starting_kit.ipynb).

To test the starting-kit, run


```
ramp-test --quick-test
```


#### Help
